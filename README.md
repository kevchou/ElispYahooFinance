ElispYahooFinance
=================

Just a little side project I started while I was bored waiting for code to run.

Written in Elisp and runs in Emacs. Pulls stock information using Yahoo Finance APIs.

More information about the Yahoo API can be found at: http://www.gummy-stuff.org/Yahoo-data.htm

Evaluate the buffer, then run the command: M-x get-yahoo-stats

It will replace the current buffer with the retrieved stock information.

Extremely unpolished and unfinished. Still lots of work to be done.
